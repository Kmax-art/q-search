# Quantum-walk search in Motion (arXiv.)

---------------


* Essential_Function.py : This contain few useful function such as vector norm, complex conjugation etc. that will used throughout the notebook.
* QWSA.py : This contains code for quantum-walk based search algorithm done for open and closed two dimensional grid. 
* QWSA_Multipoint.py : We extend the algorithm with proposed mathod as give in paper for multiple point search algorithm that reveals the marked point as well as their order. 
* Tracking.py : We use the formulation to propose the algorithm for particle tracking. The .gif or .mp4 file shows the results clearly showing the trajectory of particle as it pass through different layers.
